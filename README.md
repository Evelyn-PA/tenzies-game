# 🎲 Tenzies Game

Welcome to **Tenzies Game!**
A fun dice game built with React where you roll until all dice are the same.
But there’s a twist: you can **hold** specific dice to lock their value while you keep rolling the others.

I built this project as part of my self‑study journey through Scrimba’s Frontend Career Path to sharpen my skills in **React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

## 💡 Motivation

As a student web developer passionate about creating interactive applications, I developed this project to solidify my understanding of core React principles.

Through this project I practiced:

-   Managing complex state with React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
-   Building and passing props to reusable components
-   Implementing game logic and event handling in JavaScript
-   Creating a responsive and clean user interface with CSS

I’m currently seeking **front‑end/web development internship opportunities**, and I’d love to contribute to a team where I can learn and grow.
